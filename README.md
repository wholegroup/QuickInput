#About Quick Input

Quick Input software is used to speed up the typing of frequently repeated words and word combinations in all applications where developers have not implemented this feature. Using predictive technology, there is now no need to learn how to touch type on the keyboard!  
  
N.B. The software was designed and tested on Windows XP (32-bit) and probably won't run on newer versions of Windows
